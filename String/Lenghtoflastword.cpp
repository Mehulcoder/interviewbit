/*
Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.
If the last word does not exist, return 0.
Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.
Example:
Given s = "Hello World",
return 5 as length("World") = 5.
Please make sure you try to solve this problem without using library functions. Make sure you only traverse the string once.
